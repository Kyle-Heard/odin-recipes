    <p> Homemade Bread is one of my favorite foods of all time. Can you tell by the name of this site?! There really is
        nothing quite like a warm slice of fresh bread served with a thick pat of butter on top. Mmmmm! This recipe is
        perfect. It's simple to follow, takes about 2 hours to make and yields 2 loaves of wonderful bread. It's quite
        versatile too, so feel free to use part whole wheat flour if you'd like. Brush butter on top when it's out of
        the oven and partially cooled and everyone will thank you.</p>
    <p>A decade ago when I was just beginning to bake confidently, I still struggled with making bread. I tried
        countless recipes and none of them were quite right. I found this one and never looked back. It uses basic
        ingredients, comes together fast and I love the bread it makes. It's soft, chewy with fantastic flavor. Feel
        free to reduce the sugar if you prefer. Enjoy the process and enjoy that bread!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups warm water 110° F/45° C</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ TBSP active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 ½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>S cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>5-6 cups flour all-purpose flour OR bread flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, or a stand mixer, dissolve 2 TBSP of the sugar in the warm water.
                I just combine the two and whisk slightly to dissolve the sugar. Stir in yeast.
                Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in remaining sugar, salt and oil. Begin to mix, using a rubber scraper or the dough hook on your
                stand
                mixer. Add the flour one cup at a time, reserving the last cup of flour to see if you need it. You might
                not
                use all of the flour. The dough should pull away and clean the bowl, sticking on the bottom in a small
                circle about the size of a quarter. If your dough does this with just 5 cups of flour, do not add more.
                However, if your dough still sticks to the bowl, add more a couple tablespoons at a time until it cleans
                the
                bowl, sticking in just a small circle on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Now knead dough for 7 minutes. Set a timer as a full knead is important! Place in a well oiled bowl, and
                turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise in a warm area until doubled in bulk, about 1
                hour.</li>
            <li>Punch dough down. Knead for 1 minute and divide dough in half. Shape into loaves and place into two
                greased
                9×5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, or until dough has risen 1 inch above pans.
                Bake at 350° F (175° C) for 30-40 minutes. Cool, brush with butter and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
